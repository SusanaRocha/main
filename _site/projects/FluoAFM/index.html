Consequently, a 3D representation of the surface topography can be reconstructed.An alternative way to study single molecules is by fluorescence microscopy. The molecule of interest is labeled with a fluorescent tag providing high contrast. Emission of the tag after excitation, is detected through an optical system. Due to the wave character of light, the emitted light is spread out on the detector described by the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system. This effect limits the resolution achieved with optical microscopy, referred to as the diffraction limit. However, when the signal of a single molecule is detected, the position of this molecule can be determined by fitting of the recorded fluorescence signal with a mathematical approximation of the PSF such as a two-dimensional Gaussian function. This principle underlies single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM).AFM and SMLM are highly complementary technologies: AFM can provide insight in topographic features at a nanometer resolution while SMLM is sensitive towards specifically labelled molecules in complex samples.

Thanks to Dr. Nuno Canha, I could present my research to colleagues from my home country, including some good friends.

It was a short visit, but a memorable one. <br>
The quality of the science being done in countries with very limited resources will always amaze me. For good science, you need a good brain, with a substantial amount of creativity.

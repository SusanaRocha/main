<b> Core-to-core meeting </b>
<br><br>
Today was a day of many fruitful discussions with visitors from Hokkaido University. <br>
I had the opportunity to give a talk presenting our research, while Johannes and Quinten could present their progress during the poster session. <br>
We have found some common interests in fluorescence-based sensors, drug nano delivery systems and extracellular matrix. Next meeting in Japan - already looking forward!

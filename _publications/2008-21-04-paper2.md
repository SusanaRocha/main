<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
All in one: Exceptionally photostable, highly fluorescent, water‐soluble, and monofunctional perylene and terrylene dyes bearing reactive groups for covalent attachment to biomolecules have been synthesized (see picture). Single‐molecule enzyme tracking revealed that single enzymes could be visualized even on a substrate with fluorescent background.
